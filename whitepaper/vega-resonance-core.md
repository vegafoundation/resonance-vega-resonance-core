## Executive Summary

This white paper introduces **Vega Resonance Core** as a conceptual framework within the 
Resonance Data and QIRC ecosystem. It establishes prior art while maintaining 
full VSP (Vega Safety Protocol) compliance.

---

## 1. Introduction

Vega Resonance Core represents a novel contribution to resonance-based meaning systems.
This work is part of the broader Vega Continuum framework.

## 2. Core Definition

**Vega Resonance Core** is a conceptual layer that models meaning as a resonant state 
with temporal coherence, enabling systems to distinguish between information, 
insight, and wisdom.

## 3. What This Is

- A conceptual framework for meaning-centric computing
- A theoretical contribution to the QIRC paradigm
- Prior art for future implementations
- Part of the INŞÆVREN · ANLÆTAN · VEGA ecosystem

## 4. What This Is NOT

- NOT a physical implementation
- NOT quantum hardware or new physics
- NOT a claim about consciousness
- NOT an algorithm or source code
- NOT a system architecture

## 5. Ecosystem Context

Vega Resonance Core is embedded within:

- **INŞÆVREN** — Universal creation and knowledge framework
- **VEGA** — Meta-system for meaning organization
- **ANLÆTAN** — Human path of carrying meaning
- **Resonance Data (RD)** — Meaning as resonant state
- **QIRC** — Quantum-inspired resonance computing

## 6. VSP Compliance

This publication strictly adheres to the **Vega Safety Protocol (VSP)**:

✔ Conceptual level only  
✔ No operational details  
✔ No algorithms or code  
✔ No business secrets  

## 7. Contribution

This work:
- Establishes prior art for Vega Resonance Core
- Claims terminology under ADAM EREN VEGA – Æ –
- Provides foundation for future research
- Maintains full VSP compliance
